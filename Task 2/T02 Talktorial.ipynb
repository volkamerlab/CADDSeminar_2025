We will study our dataset to make sure it makes chemical sense and is good enough to build a model on. Finally, we will compare our models to find the one that gives the most accurate and reliable results."

    "We cannot blindly treat all solubility values as equal. We need to know if the experiments measured kinetic solubility (often used in high-throughput screening) or equilibrium solubility (the gold standard using Shake Flask). These methods yield different results for the same molecule. By understanding these experimental nuances, we can filter out noise and account for biases, leading to a more robust and scientifically accurate model.\n"

    "In this project, we utilize the AqSolDB dataset comprising around 9000 compounds from nine different public databases. This aggregation presents a major challenge due to experimental heterogeneity, as the data was not generated via a standardized protocol. Varying experimental methods across laboratories lead to variances in the 'Ground Truth' LogS values. Our modeling approach must be robust enough to discern the underlying chemical signal amidst the noise from these disparate sources."

    "We trained machine learning models using a dataset treated as a homogeneous collection, generating molecular descriptors such as Mordred and MACCS keys. However, they did not account for the experimental heterogeneity from aggregating data sources across nine different databases, which likely capped model performance due to unaddressed 'noise'.We propose that for future iterations of the project, an intensive literature search should be conducted to annotate each data point with two essential metadata columns: (1) the specific experimental protocol used, such as Shake-flask or Potentiometric, and (2) the Solubility Type (Kinetic versus Thermodynamic/Equilibrium). We believe incorporating these experimental contexts as input features or training distinct models for each solubility type could significantly reduce variance and enhance predictive accuracy."

    "We generated a wide variety of molecular descriptors through tools like Mordred and MACCS keys. We feel merely using a large number of descriptors is insufficient for effective Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling; instead, it is crucial to select features that closely correlate with Aqueous Solubility (LogS), including factors such as lipophilicity, molecular weight, polarity etc. The introduction of irrelevant descriptors can lead to the Curse of Dimensionality, where regularization methods (e.g., Lasso, Ridge) can mitigate, but not completely eliminate, the risks associated with extraneous features. The importance of a rigorous pre-filtering step to ensure that only descriptors with a proven correlation to solubility are included to avoid spurious correlations and excessive training time and overall model Performance."

    "A major limitation in our modeling strategy arose from training on all generated molecular descriptors without filtering, as we relied on the algorithm to find patterns within irrelevant data. This brute-force method is often inefficient in Chemoinformatics. Many included descriptors lack a physicochemical link to Aqueous Solubility (LogS), resulting in a diluted predictive signal and the challenge of differentiating meaningful chemical causation from random noise. A more effective approach would involve applying strict domain-based feature selection, retaining only descriptors known to affect solubility, thus simplifying the model and reducing overfitting risks."

    "#### (Only if we use current data i.e (Noisy Data); otherwise, the aforementioned modifications may not be relevant.)\n",
    "Our support vector regression (SVR) model utilized an 80-20 training-test split and was optimized through Grid Search combined with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), identifying 'best' parameters of C=10 and ϵ=0.1. Although these parameters minimized training error mathematically, A significant flaw in our modeling approach: prioritizing metrics over the chemical realities of the underlying data. Specifically, a high C value of 10 indicates a strict penalty for misclassification, encouraging the model to conform closely to outliers. Conversely, a low ϵ of 0.1 imposes a narrow fitting tolerance, compelling precise alignments to target values. This strategy, applied to the AqSolDB dataset characterized by considerable experimental noise resulted in memorizing noise rather than generalizing trends. A revised method should involve the manual adjustment of Grid Search parameters, opting for a lower C and a higher ϵ to permit greater error in fitting, thereby fostering a model that better captures the underlying solubility trends while avoiding overfitting to experimental inconsistencies."

    "### Conclusion: Model Performance vs. Chemical Reality\n",
    "1. In our comparative analysis, the Random Forest (RF) model yielded more favorable metrics than Support Vector Regression (SVR) on the training and initial challenge datasets. While RF appeared to handle the data variance somewhat more effectively, this advantage was relative. The significant performance drop observed for both models on Challenge Dataset 2 suggests that neither algorithm was fully capable of capturing the true solubility trends for complex, unseen compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The \"Hidden\" Data Problem: Experimental Heterogeneity The root cause of this generalization gap lies less in the algorithm and more in the data provenance. We treated AqSolDB as a homogeneous ground truth, but in reality, it is an aggregation of nine distinct databases with varying data densities. Crucially, we overlooked the experimental context treating Kinetic Solubility and Thermodynamic Equilibrium Solubility as identical targets. By merging these fundamentally different measurements into a single \"LogS\" target without distinguishing columns, we forced the model to learn from conflicting signals, effectively training on \"experimental noise.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Feature Space Trap Finally, our \"brute force\" approach to feature engineering generating all possible Mordred/MACCS descriptors diluted the predictive signal. Instead of learning from a curated set of physicochemical properties known to drive solubility (domain knowledge), the model was overwhelmed by hundreds of irrelevant features. Future iterations must prioritize quality over quantity in descriptor selection to build a model that is both accurate and chemically interpretable."
